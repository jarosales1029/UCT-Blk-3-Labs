complete the simple_blackjack function so that given a list of integers that represent a blackjack hand, return 
their sum conforming to the rules below. If the sum is greater than 21, return 0, unless one of the numbers is 11. 
In such a case, the 11 should be converted to a 1 to prevent the sum from exceeding 21. None of the integers 
received as input should have a value greather than 11, in such a case, return -1

expected argument type list(int,...)
expected return type int

simple_blackjack([10, 11])
  returns 21
simple_blackjack([10, 5, 11, 11, 4])
  returns 21
simple_blackjack([10, 5, 4, 11])
  returns 20
